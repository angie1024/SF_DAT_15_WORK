Your coding looks like a great start to predicting real estate investment locations.

I like how you found new imports for your project that weren't shown in class.
glob: this import reads all your files you have labeled "Permit..." saved on your desktop. Correct?
geopy: allows searching addresses and lat/long points for the location you are scouting. You can also do reverse geocoding!
I found a site that has more information regarding geocoders. I found it very informational.
https://geopy.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.96.3/

For your "print all_data.head()" coding, did you mean "all_data.head()" instead?

I've actually never heard of Nominatim before. Is this a better source than google maps? 
Would be interesting to know your reasoning for choosing Nominatim in your powerpoint slides.

When looking for crime trends, you can actually use the data we had in class. It's already cleaned up!

Thanks for sharing your project! Looks good so far and I learned new things!
